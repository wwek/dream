# Dream DRM Receiver Configuration File
# Copy this file to "Dream.ini" in your working directory to customize settings
# Command line arguments override these settings

[Receiver]
# Anti-aliasing Low Pass Filter (LPF) for audio resampling
# 1 = Enable LPF with KiwiSDR-compatible parameters (8kHz passband, 20dB attenuation)
# 0 = Disable LPF (default - no anti-aliasing filtering)
audiolpf=0

# Reverberation effect for audio dropouts
# 1 = Enable reverb effect to mask short audio dropouts (default)
# 0 = Disable reverb effect
reverb=1

# Bandpass filter for frequency synchronization acquisition
# 1 = Enable bandpass filter during frequency sync
# 0 = Disable bandpass filter (default)
filter=0

[AM Demodulation]
# Filter bandwidth settings for AM analog mode (in Hz)
# These only affect AM analog demodulation, not DRM digital mode
filterbwam=10000    # Standard AM bandwidth (10 kHz)
filterbwusb=5000    # Upper Side Band bandwidth (5 kHz)
filterbwlsb=5000    # Lower Side Band bandwidth (5 kHz)
filterbwcw=150      # CW (Morse) bandwidth (150 Hz)
filterbwfm=6000     # FM bandwidth (6 kHz)

[command]
# Frequency acquisition search window center
# -1 = Auto-detect (default)
# Other values = Manual center frequency offset in Hz
fracwincent=-1

# Example configurations:

# For testing LPF with KiwiSDR-compatible parameters:
# [Receiver]
# audiolpf=1
# reverb=1
# filter=0

# For minimal processing (all effects disabled):
# [Receiver]
# audiolpf=0
# reverb=0
# filter=0

# For challenging reception conditions:
# [Receiver]
# audiolpf=1      # Enable anti-aliasing
# reverb=1        # Enable dropout masking
# filter=1        # Enable sync bandpass filter
